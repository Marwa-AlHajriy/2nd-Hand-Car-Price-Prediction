# 2nd Hand Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a dataset of used cars from Craigslist, obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of second-hand cars based on relevant features such as vehicle age, mileage, fuel type etc.


## Data Source
- (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data?select=vehicles.csv)


## Libraries Used to code in Python Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing outliers  
   - Encoding categorical features
       
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualizing and summarizing data  
   - Understanding relationships between features and the target variable (price)
     
3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Creating new features  
   - Selecting the most relevant ones for the prediction model
     
4. **Model Building**:  
   Training and evaluating machine learning models:  
   - Linear Regression
   - LASSO
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost
     
5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Comparing models using RÂ² metric 


## Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg) on real estate price prediction. The tutorial served as a guide for structuring the project, however, I customized it to focus on second-hand car price prediction and added my own modifications.
